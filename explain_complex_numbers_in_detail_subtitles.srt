00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,964
Let's start with a question: what is a complex number, really

2
00:00:08,964 --> 00:00:17,929
On paper we write a complex number as a + bi

3
00:00:17,929 --> 00:00:26,894
But don't let the letters distract you — this is simply a point in the plane

4
00:00:26,894 --> 00:00:35,859
So the first thing we do is treat a + bi as an arrow from the origin to the point (a

5
00:00:35,859 --> 00:00:44,825
The horizontal axis is the real axis, the vertical is the imaginary axis

6
00:00:44,825 --> 00:00:53,789
The number a + bi is the arrow

7
00:00:53,789 --> 00:01:02,754
Now that arrow gives us immediate geometric language

8
00:01:02,754 --> 00:01:11,719
Adding complex numbers is just vector addition

9
00:01:11,719 --> 00:01:20,685
If I take a + bi

10
00:01:20,685 --> 00:01:29,650
place the arrow for c + di at the tip of the arrow for a + bi

11
00:01:29,650 --> 00:01:38,614
draw the diagonal — that diagonal is a + bi + (c + di)

12
00:01:38,614 --> 00:01:47,579
So addition is translation

13
00:01:47,579 --> 00:01:56,545
Nothing magical — it's the same geometry as adding displacement vectors

14
00:01:56,545 --> 00:02:05,509
Multiplication is where the plane reveals a richer, more interesting structure

15
00:02:05,509 --> 00:02:14,474
What does it mean to multiply complex numbers

16
00:02:14,474 --> 00:02:23,439
Let's build intuition slowly

17
00:02:23,439 --> 00:02:32,405
First, multiplying by a real number stretches or shrinks the arrow

18
00:02:32,405 --> 00:02:41,370
Multiply by 2, the arrow doubles in length; multiply by 0

19
00:02:41,370 --> 00:02:50,335
5, it halves

20
00:02:50,335 --> 00:02:59,300
So real scaling is radial scaling

21
00:02:59,300 --> 00:03:08,264
But what about multiplying by i

22
00:03:08,264 --> 00:03:17,229
Every point on the plane is multiplied by i: the entire plane rotates 90 degrees counterclockwise

23
00:03:17,229 --> 00:03:26,194
Every arrow rotates without changing its length

24
00:03:26,194 --> 00:03:35,159
So i acts like a 90-degree rotation operator

25
00:03:35,159 --> 00:03:44,125
Multiplication by -1 flips the arrow 180 degrees

26
00:03:44,125 --> 00:03:53,090
Multiplying by -i rotates 90 degrees clockwise

27
00:03:53,090 --> 00:04:02,055
So multiplication

28
00:04:02,055 --> 00:04:11,019
does two things: it scales lengths

29
00:04:11,019 --> 00:04:19,985
rotates directions

30
00:04:19,985 --> 00:04:28,949
We can capture that neatly by switching to polar coordinates

31
00:04:28,949 --> 00:04:37,915
Any nonzero complex number z can be written as r e to the i theta

32
00:04:37,915 --> 00:04:46,879
where r is the length (|z|)

33
00:04:46,879 --> 00:04:55,844
theta is the angle the arrow makes with the real axis (arg z)

34
00:04:55,844 --> 00:05:04,810
In these terms

35
00:05:04,810 --> 00:05:13,774
multiplication becomes obvious: (r1 e to the i theta1) times (r2 e to the i theta2) = (r1 r2) e to the i (theta1 + theta2)

36
00:05:13,774 --> 00:05:22,740
Multiplying multiplies radii and adds angles

37
00:05:22,740 --> 00:05:31,704
This polar expression is tightly tied to Euler's formula

38
00:05:31,704 --> 00:05:40,670
e to the i theta = cos theta + i sin theta

39
00:05:40,670 --> 00:05:49,634
So an exponential with an imaginary exponent traces out a circle as theta varies

40
00:05:49,634 --> 00:05:58,600
As theta increases linearly

41
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:07,564
the point moves around a circle centered at the origin

42
00:06:07,564 --> 00:06:16,529
Now that we can multiply

43
00:06:16,529 --> 00:06:25,495
think in terms of scaling

44
00:06:25,495 --> 00:06:34,459
a whole family of visual phenomena becomes easy to understand

45
00:06:34,459 --> 00:06:43,425
Powers: raise a number to a power n

46
00:06:43,425 --> 00:06:52,389
In polar form, (r e to the i theta) to the n = r to the n e to the i n theta

47
00:06:52,389 --> 00:07:01,355
So raising to the second power squares the radius and doubles the angle

48
00:07:01,355 --> 00:07:10,319
Let's look at a grid under the map z maps to z squared

49
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:19,284
Points with different radii accelerate apart because radii are squared

50
00:07:19,284 --> 00:07:28,250
angles are doubled so every petal
