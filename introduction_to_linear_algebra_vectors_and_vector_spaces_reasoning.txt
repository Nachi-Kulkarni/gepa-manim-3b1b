# Animation Reasoning for: Introduction to Linear Algebra: Vectors and Vector Spaces

The goal is to create a visually rich introduction to vectors and vector spaces in the 3Blue1Brown style. The animation will progress through several phases:

1. **Introduction of a single vector**: Start with a dark void, fade in a faint Cartesian grid, and grow a glowing red arrow from the origin. Display the vector notation [3, 2] beside it, then slide it under the arrow. This emphasizes the concept of a vector as a motion rather than just a point.

2. **Expansion to multiple vectors**: Fade in duplicate arrows in muted colors, all rooted at the origin. Slowly zoom out to reveal an endless constellation of arrows, illustrating the vastness of possible vectors.

3. **Focus on building-block vectors**: Dim the swarm to highlight three key vectors (red, green, blue). Animate these vectors stretching, shrinking, and reversing in real time, showing how they can trace out the entire plane through combinations.

4. **Introduction of vector space**: Brighten the grid and display the text "Vector Space" overhead. Emphasize that the plane has become an algebraic object governed by vector addition and scalar multiplication.

5. **Transition to next concept**: Fade to black while hinting at the next question about which vectors are truly necessary.

Key visual elements:
- Dark background with faint grid
- Glowing red arrow as the primary vector
- Coordinates displayed as MathTex
- Multiple arrows in muted colors
- Smooth camera zoom-out effect
- Real-time vector transformations
- Text labels for key concepts
